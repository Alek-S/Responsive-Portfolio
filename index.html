			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<img src="./assets/images/profile.jpg" alt="Profile Picture" id="profilePic">
			<p>I'm an aspiring web developer currently located in the Chicago area. I've been dabbling into web development specifically (HTML/CSS/JS) at the hobbyist level for both personal and work tasks for about a year.</p>	

			<p>I use SQL (PostgreSQL) on a near daily basis for analysis and data reporting tasks at work. Related to this, I have also experimented with Node.js for automating operational data reporting tasks. I have also been maintaining existing Python scripts originally created by the company's former data scientist. Some of my favorite libraries have been jQuery, Underscore.js and C3.js for the front end, and Baby Parse for Node.js projects.</p>	

			<p>Outside of coding, one of my other great passions has been photography, primarily street photography. This goes hand-in-hand my other interest, international travel. I have spent time in France, China, Malaysia, Peru, Vietnam, and Nepal. My big bucket list travel destinations are Mongolia and Kingdom of Bhutan.</p>
